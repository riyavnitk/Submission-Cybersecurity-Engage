# Final Submission
This repository consists of scripts and models that could be deployed in real time ADS-B systems to improve security in the aviation infrastructure. 

This repository has includes the following systems :
- CVE Scanner
- Encryption algorithms that could be employed in ADS-B

## CVE Scanner
- Mapping the generated NMap scan file to the respective vulnerabilities in the CVE database. 
--This is required for constant monitoring of the currently deployed systems by checking the version of the Windows OS in the NMap Scan and the corresponding vulnerabilities in the CVE database.)
-- Reference : https://github.com/NorthernSec/CVE-Scan


## Encryption Algorithms for ADS-B 
- A possible implementation of the encryption algorithms that can be employed in ADS-B systems.
