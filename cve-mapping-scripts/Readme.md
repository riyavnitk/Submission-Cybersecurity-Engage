This is a collection of scripts to scan the CVE database for gathering information about recent vulnerabilities corresponding to the version of operating system installed. This will smoothen the process of awareness and monitoring among the engineers maintaining the ADS-B systems.

###### Usage:
Storing the output of NMap Scan :
```nmap -A -O 192.168.0.1 -oX output.xml```

Now running the script:
